# End-to-End Speech Translation

## Overview
- **One-to-One Mapping:**  
  Establishing a direct correspondence between frequently used words in both languages ensures accurate translation. This mapping serves as a dynamic dictionary, facilitating efficient translation with customizable word accommodation.

- **Overcoming Communication Barriers:**  
  We tackle challenges such as accents and background noise through a comprehensive strategy. While accent recognition and speech modification are complex, our focus on noise reduction using existing models lays the foundation. Future iterations may explore advanced techniques for accent recognition and modification.

- **Translation and Reconstruction Model:**
  - **Literal Translation:** Initially, we translate sentences literally using the established mapping.
  - **Sentence Reconstruction:** A specialized model rearranges translated sentences into coherent expressions, preserving the original meaning amidst semi-jumbled structures.

## Development Process
- **Data Collection:** Gathering thousands of accurate sentences for model training.
- **Training:** The model learns sentence restructuring while maintaining syntactical correctness.
- **Part-Of-Speech Recognition:** Integrating part-of-speech recognition aids in sentence reconstruction.
- **Adaptive AI Integration:** The model evolves through adaptive AI, gathering data with each use for improved accuracy.

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies as specified.
2. Utilize provided code for mapping.
3. Input source language sentences.
4. Apply translation and reconstruction for coherent target language output.

## Future Directions
- **Advanced Speech Modification:** Explore accent recognition and modification.
- **Semantic Understanding:** Enhance reconstruction through semantic understanding.
- **User Feedback Mechanism:** Implement feedback loops for continual model improvement.
